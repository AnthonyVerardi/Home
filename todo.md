## To-do #1
Due 1/9 (Th), 12:30pm

The Internet is full of published linguistic data sets. Let's data-surf! Instructions:

1. Go out and find **two linguistic data sets** you like. One should be a corpus, the other should be some other format. They must be free and downloadable in full. Make sure they are _linguistic_ data sets, meaning designed for linguistic inquiries.
1. You might want to start with various bookmark sites listed in the following Learning Resources sections: [Linguistic Data, Open Access, Data Publishing](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2020/Home/blob/master/resources.md#linguistic_data), and [Corpus Linguistics](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2020/Home/blob/master/resources.md#corpus). But don't be constrained by them.
1. Download the data sets and poke around. Open up a file or two to take a peek. (No need to do this in Python.)
1. In a text file (should have the `.txt` extension), make note of:
  - The name of the data resource
  - The author(s)
  - The URL of the download page
  - Its makeup: size, type of language, format, etc.
  - License: whether it comes with one, and if so what kind?
  - Anything else noteworthy about the data. A sentence or two will do.
1. If you are comfortable with [markdown](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists-2020/Home/blob/master/resources.md#markdown), make an `.md` file instead of a text file.

**SUBMISSION**: Upload your text file to To-do1 submission link, on CourseWeb. If you do not have CourseWeb access, email your submission to Jevon cc Cassie and John.

## To-do #2
Due 1/16 (Th), 12:30pm

Learn about the `numpy` library: study the _Python Data Science Handbook_ and/or the NumPy documentation [here](https://numpy.org/doc/).
While doing so, create your own study notes, as a Jupyter Notebook file entitled `numpy_notes_yourname.ipynb`.
Include examples, explanations, etc. Replicating DataCamp's examples is also something you could do.
You are essentially creating your own reference material.

**SUBMISSION**: Your file should be in the `todo2/` directory of the `Class-Exercise-Repo`.
Make sure it's configured for the "upstream" remote and your fork is up-to-date. Push to your GitHub fork, and create a pull request for me.
